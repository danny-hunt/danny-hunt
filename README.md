### Introduction

Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Danny. I'm a Full Stack & AI Engineer and ex-Founder based in London who has been working for start-ups for YEARS.

For my last role as Founding Engineer at Wordware I was flown out to SF zero-notice to boost engineering capacity during the busy YC period. There I:

- Scaled app performance in 2 days when usage suddenly spiked to 4 million users
- Rebuilt a prompt-first programming language to break out of the http request lifecycle & migrate from Vercel -> Cloudflare reducing costs by 80%
- Implemented Stripe payments subscription & usage billing for LLMs & other tools
- Saved 0.5% of the cap table (yes really)

I'm actively looking for new roles either in London or remote. I love:

- Leading and pushing a team forward
- Working on difficult technical challenges
- Working with people that are passionate about what they do
- Getting STUFF done

Reach out if any of this sounds interesting to you, or if you just want to chat!
