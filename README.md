### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Danny

Currently a Software Engineer @ Cogna writing code to write code to test code written by code. I love my job.

Previously:

2024 - **Founding Engineer at Wordware** (YC S24 - raised $30m) - flown out zero-notice to boost engineering capacity during the busy YC batch period. There I:

- Scaled app performance in 48 hours when usage spiked to 4 million daily users
- Rebuilt a prompt-first programming language to break out of the http request lifecycle & migrate from Vercel -> Cloudflare reducing costs by 80%
- Implemented Stripe payments subscription & usage billing to pass on costs for ~18 third-party LLM & data APIs

In previous roles I tend to do the hard stuff:

- Built a system for hosting & spinning up arbitrary LLM models on demand for adversarial research
- Performance-optimized an excel-like spreadsheet formula language
- Managed a product team building out a public API & in-app scripting functionality for a SaaS product
- Much more...
