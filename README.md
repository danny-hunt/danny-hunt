### Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Danny

I'm a Software Engineer @ Cogna and ex-Founder based in London. Currently writing code to write code to test code written by code.


Last Summer I was in SF working as a Founding Engineer at Wordware (YC S24) - flown out zero-notice to boost engineering capacity during the busy YC batch period. There I:

- Scaled app performance in 2 days when usage suddenly spiked to 4 million users
- Rebuilt a prompt-first programming language to break out of the http request lifecycle & migrate from Vercel -> Cloudflare reducing costs by 80%
- Implemented Stripe payments subscription & usage billing to pass on costs for 20-25 third party LLM & data APIs

In previous roles I have:

- Built a system for hosting & spinning up arbitrary LLM models on demand for adversarial research
- Performance-optimized an excel-like spreadsheet formula language
- Managed a product team building out a public API & in-app scripting functionality for a SaaS product
- Much more...
